I'm just yet another web developer. Working full-time job and sometimes contributing to the stuff I use or enjoy.

## Languages:

- **PHP** — Mostly have experience working with WordPress, but I have very tiny amount of experience with Laravel and some other CMS;
- **JS/TS** — Have a lot of experience working with vanilla JS/TS, most of the time spent making front-end JS, but server-side JS isn't that different;
- **CSS/SCSS** — Very comfortable working with all modern CSS features, prefer to use SCSS, since it's easier to manage big projects with it.

## Tech, Libraries & Frameworks:

- **Vite** — My curreny bundler of choice, it have replaced Webpack due to how fast it is and how easier it is to modify my builds;
- **Vue** — Had some experience in the past, but not doing anything with this library for a while now.

### For personal use:

These are reasearched & used by me when trying to make something outside of work time.

- **Browser Extensions** — Have successfuly made and published an extension for myself;
- **Svelte/SvelteKit** — I'm trying to use it in my personal projects, but never had a chance to try in anything big;

## Software:

- **PHPStorm** — My current daily driver for a long time.
